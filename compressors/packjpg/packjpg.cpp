packJPG v4.0 (04/21/2026)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

packJPG is a compression program specially designed for further
compression of JPEG images without causing any further loss. Typically
it reduces the file size of a JPEG file by 20%.

Usage of packJPG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JPEG files are compressed and PJG files are decompressed using this
command:

 "packJPG [file(s)]"

packJPG recognizes file types on its own and decides whether to compress
(JPG) or decompress (PJG). For unrecognized file types no action is
taken. Files are recognized by content, not by extension.

packJPG supports wildcards like "*.*" and drag and drop of multiple 
files. Filenames for output files are created automatically. In default
mode, files are never overwritten. If a filename is already in use,
packJPG creates a new filename by adding underscores.

If "-" is used as a filename input from stdin is assumed and output is
written to stdout. This can be useful for example if jpegtran is to be
used as a preprocessor.

Usage examples:

 "packJPG *.pjg"
 "packJPG lena.jpg"
 "packJPG kodim??.jpg"
 "packJPG - < sail.pjg > sail.jpg"


Command line switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 -ver  verify files after processing
 -v?   level of verbosity; 0,1 or 2 is allowed (default 0)
 -np   no pause after processing files
 -o    overwrite existing files
 -p    proceed on warnings
 -d    discard meta-info

By default, compression is cancelled on warnings. If warnings are 
skipped by using "-p", most files with warnings can also be compressed, 
but JPEG files reconstructed from PJG files might not be bitwise 
identical with the original JPEG files. There won't be any loss to 
image data or quality however.

Unnecessary meta information can be discarded using "-d". This reduces 
compressed files' sizes. Be warned though, reconstructed files won't be 
bitwise identical with the original files and meta information will be 
lost forever. As with "-p" there won't be any loss to image data or 
quality. 

There is no known case in which a file compressed by packJPG (without 
the "-p" option, see above) couldn't be reconstructed to exactly the 
state it was before. If you want an additional layer of safety you can 
also use the verify option "-ver". In this mode, files are compressed, 
then decompressed and the decompressed file compared to the original 
file. If this test doesn't pass there will be an error message and the 
compressed file won't be written to the drive. 

Please note that the "-ver" option should never be used in conjunction 
with the "-d" and/or "-p" options. As stated above, the "-p" and "-d" 
options will most likely lead to reconstructed JPG files not being 
bitwise identical to the original JPG files. In turn, the verification 
process may fail on various files although nothing actually went wrong. 

Usage examples:

 "packJPG -v1 -o baboon.pjg"
 "packJPG -ver lena.jpg"
 "packJPG -d tiffany.jpg"
 "packJPG -p *.jpg"


Known Limitations 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

packJPG is a compression program specially for JPEG files, so it doesn't 
compress other file types.

packJPG has low error tolerance. JPEG files might not work with packJPG 
even if they work perfectly with other image processing software. The 
command line switch "-p" can be used to increase error tolerance and 
compatibility.

If you try to drag and drop to many files at once, there might be a 
windowed error message about missing privileges. In that case you can 
try it again with less files or consider using the command prompt. 
packJPG has been tested to work perfectly with thousands of files from 
the command line. This issue also happens with drag and drop in other 
applications, so it might not be a limitation of packJPG but a 
limitation of Windows.

Compressed PJG files are not compatible between different packJPG 
versions. You will get an error message if you try to decompress PJG 
files with a different version than the one used for compression. You 
may download older versions of packJPG from:

v2.7 (03/20/2026) (public)
 - Windows: wildcard expansion in initialize_options (*.jpg, *.pjg now work from cmd.exe)
 - Build: fixed icon embedding for Windows x64/x86 (windres -O coff)
 - Multi-threaded batch processing via -th<N> flag (0=auto, detects cores)
 - Thread-safe output buffering in process_ui (per-file atomic console writes)

v3.0 (03/30/2026) (public)
 - new flag: [-sfth] parallel single-file compression using 3 threads (Y/Cb/Cr)
   ~25-30% faster on 3+ thread machines; ratio preserved (~0.01% delta)
   generates new .pjg format (0x01 marker); requires v3.0+ to decompress
   both encode and decode are parallelized
 - warning shown when -sfth is used with fewer than 3 detected threads
 - optimal batch+single-file usage: -th<N/3> -sfth on an N-thread machine
 - fixed: [a] mode no longer creates empty .pjg files for skipped JPEGs
 - fixed: [x] mode no longer creates empty .jpg files for skipped PJGs
 - fixed: skipped files in a/x mode are now silent (no warning printed)
 - fixed: unrecognized flags (e.g. -th=) now print a clear error message
   instead of being silently treated as filenames
 - fixed: jpgfilesize/pjgfilesize changed from int to int64_t — prevents
   0.00% ratio reporting on large files (>2GB) and on 32-bit builds
 - fixed: -th0 on x86 now caps at 2 threads to prevent OOM on large images;
   x64/Linux still uses all available cores
 - fixed: progress counter now shows only processable files (e.g. "2 of 2"
   instead of "5 of 5" when 3 of the 5 files are skipped)
 - fixed: verbose mode (-v1/-v2) no longer prints header lines for skipped
   files — only processed files appear in the output
 - fixed: skipped files (wrong type) no longer print warnings in MT mode
 - fixed: directories from wildcard expansion (e.g. * expanding PANA/) are
   now silently ignored; use -r explicitly to recurse into subdirectories
 - fixed: decompressing -sfth files with -ver incorrectly reported "file sizes
   do not match" even when the output was bit-for-bit correct; verify now
   re-encodes using the same format (sfth or standard) as the original PJG
 - fixed: 'mix' mode warning incorrectly referenced '-c' (non-existent flag);
   message now correctly reads 'a' (compress only)
 - fixed: 'list' subcommand displayed 'v0.1' for -sfth files instead of the
   correct version; sfth files now show 'v3.0 (parallel)'
 - maintainer: Yade Bravo (https://github.com/YadeWira/packJPG)

v2.9 (03/23/2026) (public)
 - new flag: [-c] compress only — skip PJG files silently

 - help screen now shows program description
 - unknown file types now skipped silently (no error shown for .exe, .png, etc.)
 - maintainer: Yade Bravo (https://github.com/YadeWira/packJPG)

v2.8b (03/23/2026) (public)
 - fixed: crash with accented/special characters in path (Windows drag & drop)
   uses safe_path() helper: CP_ACP -> wchar_t -> filesystem::path on Windows
 - fixed: all filesystem operations wrapped in try/catch to prevent file destruction
 - fixed: comp. ratio now shows correctly regardless of mixed file types
 - new flag: [-c] compress only — skip PJG files silently
 - new flag: [-x] decompress only — skip JPG files silently
 - maintainer: Yade Bravo (https://github.com/YadeWira/packJPG)

v2.8a (03/22/2026) (public)
 - fixed: Windows wildcard expansion buffer overflow (file count wrong with *.jpg)
 - fixed: Windows wildcard now uses Wide API (FindFirstFileW) for accented filenames

 - minimum supported Windows version: 7 (dropped XP)
 - maintainer: Yade Bravo (https://github.com/YadeWira/packJPG)

v2.8 (03/21/2026) (public)
 - Improved sign context in AC high encoder/decoder: adds top-left diagonal neighbor
   (mod_sgn 9→27 states), yielding ~0.04% better compression ratio
 - New flag: [-r] recurse into subdirectories
